# Test-a-perceptual-phenomenen:

## 1. Introduction :
In this project I investigated a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the [Stroop Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect).
The main purpose is to explore a dataset and then use  statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results.
The phenomenon refers to the delayed reaction times when the color of the word doesn't match the name of the word and was  It was first described during the 1930s by American psychologist John Ridley Stroop for whom the phenomenon is named.<br>

### Background Information:
In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example RED, BLUE. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example PURPLE, ORANGE. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.

### The investigated question : 
Given a dataset in which we have results from a number of participants in the task, Can we say that  there is a difference in time between the congruent reading and the incongruent reading.
